Farm to Fridge
=======================

Farm to Fridge is a project to develop and release open source
Farm Market software.  The Software is being developed by Daniel Bingham
(http://www.theroadgoeson.com) in concert with the Bloomington Local Growers
Guild (http://www.localgrowers.org).  We're hoping to have a beta version ready
for this market season to serve the Bloomington Community as an online
supplement to the existing Farmer's market.  We hope the market will serve both
individual buyers who cannot make the market, but still want local produce and
local restaurants who wish to purchase local produce wholesale.

Initially the software will be developed to serve the needs of the Bloomington
market.  However, if sufficient support can be found, we intend to develop it
to serve general needs.  It is my hope to eventually develop software that can
be configured to serve any of the following purposes:

    - As a single farm's online market, with either pickup or delivery
    - As a communities online farmer's market supporting multiple farms, with
      either pickup or delivery
    - As an online wholesale distributor to allow local growers to sell their
      products to local restaurants and food service providers
    - And as anything else anyone can bend it into doing to service local foods
      and support local growers

It will be released under the fully permissive MIT License and -- again,
depending upon support -- continuously developed and updated.
